/**
 * Interface to provide caching to the {@link DeliveryClient}.
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this can be provided via {@link DeliveryClient#setCacheManager(CacheManager)} and it is invoked
 * before every API request.  It is expected to return a {@link JsonNode} representation of the API response.  In the
 * case of a cache miss, the {@link HttpRequestExecutor} provides an {@code .execute()} callback which returns JsonNode
 * from the KenticoCloud endpoint.  This JsonNode can then be stored by the CacheManager, and returned per the contract.
 * <p>
 * It is up to the CacheManager to determine how to key it's cache, and how much it will introspect the JsonNode,
 * however due to varying operations that can be done with the {@link DeliveryParameterBuilder}, it is highly
 * recommended to key off the {@code requestUri}.
 * <p>
 * A CacheManager also can leverage notifications from KenticoCloud's webhooks that can be sent when the project's
 * content is changed.
 * <p>
 * This is a {@link FunctionalInterface} to simplify implementation.
 * <p>
 * A simple implementation of this would be as follows (although this example isn't thread safe, do not use):
 * <pre>{@code
 * Map<String, JsonNode> memoryCache = new HashMap<>();
 * deliveryClient.setCacheManager((requestUri, executor) -> {
 *         if (memoryMap.containsKey(requestUri)){
 *             return memoryMap.get(requestUri);
 *         } else {
 *             JsonNode jsonNode = executor.execute();
 *             memoryMap.put(requestUri, jsonNode);
 *             return jsonNode;
 *         }
 *     }
 * );
 * ...
 * protected void purgeCache() {
 *     memoryCache = new HashMap<>();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * By default, if no CacheManager is provided, the DeliveryClient will use it's default, which just passes through:
 * <pre>{@code
 * private CacheManager cacheManager = (requestUri, executor) -> executor.execute();
 * }</pre>
 *
